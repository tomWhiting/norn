# Decisions for Owner Sign-off — Norn Hardening Campaign (2026-07)

This file consolidates every decision the hardening-campaign agents recorded while
implementing (tracks T1-T9) and integrating (seams I1-I3) the `hardening/final-state` briefs.
Nothing here was invented by this document — every line is drawn from an agent's own
structured `decisions` report at the end of its run, or (for §5) from a resolved decision doc
and the Wave 3-4 commit record. Wave 2's planning journal (`wf_5c41d368-666`) recorded a brief
plan, not implementation decisions, so it contributes nothing to §1-4.

**Sections 1-4** cover Waves 1-2 (the original draft). **Section 5** was added after the draft
and covers the R1 assembly-unification decisions (D1-D7, resolved autonomously while the owner
was away) and the load-bearing decisions of Wave 3 (`32fa720`/`9ac8186`/`8ac4aad`, R1 assembly
unification) and Wave 4 (`3c84682`, R2 runner state machine + deterministic tool ordering +
repo-wide LOC/purity sweep). Every §5 entry states the decision, the file path where it lives
at HEAD (`3c84682`), and whether it needs owner attention.

Per CLAUDE.md's **NO ARBITRARY LIMITS / NO ASSUMED DEFAULTS** rule, agents were required to
flag any numeric/behavioral default they touched. Section 1 below is the complete list of
those flagged defaults — in every case the agent reused a pre-existing constant rather than
inventing a new magic number, and each is exposed as configurable. Section 2 catalogs the
non-numeric behavioral/semantic calls made while implementing the briefs. Section 3 pulls out
the items agents explicitly marked as unresolved or requiring an owner decision. Section 4
reproduces the two items already held out of the campaign entirely.

Recommendation key: **Keep** = agent's rationale is sound, ratify as-is. **Discuss** = agent
implemented something reasonable but explicitly asked for sign-off or flagged an alternative.
**Revisit** = works today but has a known gap (e.g., no override plumbed yet).

## 0. Items most needing owner attention (read these first)

The three below are the highest-priority calls — the first is a genuine design fork, the other
two are behaviors an agent explicitly wrote "needs sign-off" against. Full detail in §3.

1. **`step_timeout` graceful-timeout redesign** (§3). — **DECIDED 2026-07-02 (owner)**: agents
   may run for hours; there is **no timeout by default** (the existing `step_timeout: None`
   default is confirmed correct and must stay). For callers that opt in via `--timeout` /
   `AgentLoopConfig::step_timeout`, today's documented hard-cut semantics stand; the graceful
   grace-period redesign is **dropped** (it would invent a grace default for a knob the owner
   considers niche).
2. **`WalkBuilder::require_git(false)`** in the search/file tools (§2, §3). — **DECIDED
   2026-07-02 (owner)**: ratified. Outside a git repo there is normally no `.gitignore`, so the
   behavior is moot there; where ignore files do exist, applying them deterministically is
   right. The escape hatch the owner asked for already exists: the per-call `include_ignored`
   parameter (default `false`) walks ignored files on request.
3. **Binary / non-UTF-8 `InvalidData` silent-skip carve-out** in content/AST search (§2, §3).
   — **DECIDED 2026-07-03 (owner)**: ratified as-is. A binary file cannot contain a text
   match, so nothing is hidden by omitting it from `skipped` (which exists to flag results
   that may be incomplete); listing every image/object file would be noise. Matches
   grep/ripgrep behavior. Every other read error is still reported in `skipped`.

4. **Zero-tool agents are supported** — **DECIDED 2026-07-02 (owner-driven fix)**: the former
   `AgentBuilder::build` rejection ("no tools available after exclusions; an agent needs at
   least one tool") is removed. A zero-tool agent (`--allowed-tools ""`, or a profile with
   `tools = []`) is a legitimate pure text-transform configuration (e.g. the owner's TTS
   rewrite pipeline): the system prompt omits its `# Tools` section and provider requests
   carry no tool definitions. The invariant predated the campaign but only reached the CLI
   when R1 unified assembly onto `build()` — it broke a previously-working invocation.
   Regression tests: `zero_tool_agent_builds_for_transform_only_use` (library),
   `empty_allowed_tools_builds_zero_tool_transform_agent` (CLI fence).

5. **Auto-compaction is armed by default for every library-launched agent (root and
   children); reserve-token semantics** — **DECIDED 2026-07-03 (owner)**, after a real
   driven-mode run died `ContextWindowExceeded` at 269k input tokens
   with zero compactions (session `faaa1b04…`, 133 steps). Root cause: the trigger required
   BOTH `context_window_limit` AND `auto_compact_threshold_pct`, and both defaulted `None` —
   an over-reading of the no-defaults rule. Owner clarification (now in CLAUDE.md): the rule
   is **no ARBITRARY defaults** — factual defaults (the generated model catalog's per-model
   `context_window`) and owner-ruled defaults are fine. Rulings: (a) `context_window_limit`
   defaults from `model_catalog::smallest_context_window_for_model` when not explicitly
   configured (explicit config always wins; models absent from the catalog stay `None`);
   (b) the percentage threshold is REPLACED (no compat alias) by
   `auto_compact_reserve_tokens: Option<u64>`, default **`Some(30_000)`** (owner's value) —
   trigger fires when estimated tokens exceed `window − reserve` (gpt-5.5: 272_000 − 30_000
   = 242_000); explicit `off` disables (settings string `"off"` / `-c
   auto_compact_reserve_tokens=off` — for orchestrators that manage context themselves;
   owner guidance 2026-07-03: on very large-window models, prefer lowering the effective
   ceiling — an explicit `context_window` below the catalog value, e.g. 500k on a 1M model —
   over turning compaction off);
   `reserve ≥ window` warns loudly and disables (would otherwise fire every step; the builder
   also warns once and drops the system-prompt compaction guidance). Reserve is absolute, not proportional, because it is sized by
   turn overhead (next input + compaction summary call), which does not scale with window
   size. (c) **The trigger signal is usage-anchored**: the chars/4 client estimate cannot see
   the true cost of encrypted reasoning items (incident numbers: estimate ~236k vs provider-
   reported 269k), so the trigger and the advisory `loop.token_warning` fire on
   `max(estimate, usage_floor)` where the floor is the previous step's provider-reported
   `input_tokens + output_tokens`. The floor lives on `ContextEdits` and is cleared by every
   conversation-shrinking mutation (suppress/summarize/compact/commit/mark_superseded — a
   structural invariant, preventing a stale floor from re-firing compaction in a loop) and is
   never seeded from resumed events. Caveat (flagged): providers reporting cache reads
   outside `input_tokens` understate the floor — safe direction (`max` with the estimate),
   but the anchor is weaker there. The client estimate counts persisted reasoning items
   (encrypted blob + summary/content parts; deliberate overestimate — safe direction), so the
   first post-resume call is covered even though the floor is never seeded from resumed
   events. Related: **(i) child agents have no compaction machinery — RULED 2026-07-03
   (owner): auto-compaction covers ALL agents**, sub-agents and forks included ("we can't
   have them dying mid-work deep in the stack"; children *shouldn't* normally run long
   enough to need it, but coverage is required). **DONE**: one shared
   `arm_auto_compaction(loop_context, config, model)` (agent/assembly.rs) installs the
   estimator + `ContextEdits` and fills the catalog window per-agent; the builder AND all
   three child launch paths (spawn, fork, rhai `spawn_agent`) call it — root and children
   cannot drift. Children compact on their in-memory stores session-lessly. Scoping notes:
   child system prompts have no compaction-guidance seam (pre-existing; the runtime trigger
   is what mattered), and "all agents" means all *library-launched* agents — an embedder
   hand-rolling `run_agent_step` on a self-built `LoopContext` (e.g. the demo examples)
   must call `arm_auto_compaction` itself; the function's rustdoc is the discoverable
   contract. Still open: (ii) reactive compact-and-retry on
   `ContextWindowExceeded` (currently
   Terminal) as the safety net for catalog-miss models; (iii) the owner's planned
   session-storage/event-prominence redesign (per-event prominence levels so low-value
   events — search results, bash output — can be dropped or substituted before
   summarization-grade compaction is needed). Reasoning persistence: ruled and done — see
   the §3 entry.

6. **Skills & delegation rulings (owner, 2026-07-03/04):**
   (a) **Skill scan tiers**: the `cwd/.meridian/skills` tier is legacy experimentation —
   removed; `~/.norn` (NORN_HOME-aware) is the central home-level store, project `.norn` the
   project store; `.agents`/`.claude` convention tiers remain.
   (b) **Confinement carve-out APPROVED**: under a workspace root, agents may READ the
   discovered skill search paths and profile/config directories (home-level skills'
   companion files were reported but unreadable). Write allowance + a Claude-Code-style
   progressively-merged permission config surface for it: follow-up design, owner-sketched.
   (c) **`ChildLoopConfig.max_iterations` REMOVED outright** (the model-suppliable spawn
   grant): it was a silent cutoff — the child was never told its budget, just stopped at the
   gate, so granted children "always error"; models chronically underestimate action counts.
   The root/embedder config knob stays; the model-facing grant goes.
   (d) **Nested delegation: default depth 1 → 2** (children may spawn one level of their
   own), configurable via settings/`-c` (owner ruled the value; inherit-with-decrement and
   narrowing-only invariants unchanged). Prebuilt role profiles (PM/scrum-master, developer,
   reviewer) noted for the internal-agents assistant-hats phase.
   (e) **Cron tool requirements** (for the brief): relative wake-ups ("in N"), time-of-day,
   and looping intervals (minutes/hours/days); fired schedules deliver as injected messages;
   schedules persist as session events (resume restores); no caps on count or interval;
   in-session first, daemon phase later. **Extension applied 2026-07-04 (flagged for owner
   confirmation)**: the resume ruling's no-backfill semantics are extended to LIVE catch-up —
   after a process suspend (laptop sleep freezes timers while wall time jumps), a recurring
   schedule fires ONCE and re-arms from now with the skipped occurrences logged, instead of
   replaying every missed occurrence as a burst (an 8-hour sleep on `every: "1m"` would
   otherwise inject ~480 stacked steers). Same semantics, same rationale, new code path —
   surfaced by the N-026 Fable review.

Beyond these, §5.1 (R1 D1-D7) were **applied autonomously while the owner was away** and are all
reversible on `hardening/final-state` before merge — the owner may override any of them.

## 1. Documented overridable defaults

---

## 2. Semantic / behavioral choices

### Search & file tools — T3-search, T2a-tools-core
- `include_ignored` defaults to `false` (filtering on by default, explicit opt-in). — **Keep**
- Ignore rules use `WalkBuilder::require_git(false)`: `.gitignore`/`.ignore`/global excludes apply even outside a git repo, for deterministic behavior across repo and non-repo trees. Agent explicitly flagged **needs sign-off**. — **Discuss**
- Binary/non-UTF-8 files (`io::ErrorKind::InvalidData` on read) are skipped silently in content/AST modes (no matchable text); every other read error is still reported in `skipped`. Agent explicitly flagged **needs sign-off** on the carve-out. — **Discuss**
- `files` mode reimplemented on the walker with root-relative pattern matching instead of `glob::Pattern::escape`-ing the base path — removes the base-path-injection class entirely (root-cause fix for R5) and lets `files` mode honor ignore rules. — **Keep**
- Confinement refusal returned as a tool failure output (`kind=confinement_refused`, `ToolErrorKind::PermissionDenied`), matching the Read/Write/Edit convention, rather than a Rust-level `ToolError`. — **Keep**
- AST partial compile failures surfaced in a new additive `query_errors` output array, preserving graceful degradation for mixed-language trees. — **Keep**
- Symlinks are not followed during walks and symlink entries are never content-read; the search root itself is symlink-checked by confinement's canonicalization. — **Keep**
- An explicitly named file passed as `path` is always searched even if gitignored — explicit reference is treated as intent. — **Keep**
- `search/mod.rs` restructured to declarations/re-exports only (CLAUDE.md mod.rs rule); logic split into `tool.rs`/`content.rs`/`file_find.rs`/`helpers.rs`. — **Keep**
- `SkillToolConfig::default` keeps `shell_execution = true` (preserves established `agentskills.io` `!\`command\`` expansion behavior); embedders disable via `SkillTool::with_config`. `effect()` reports `Process` when enabled, `ReadOnly` when disabled. — **Keep**
- `WebFetchTool::with_client` deleted rather than "verifying" the redirect policy on a caller-supplied client (unauditable once built) — the tool now owns all client construction (`Policy::none`, resolver pinning). Breaking API change, per no-backwards-compat rule. — **Keep**
- Bare-registry direct dispatch surfaces `tool_use_description` via `tracing::debug` rather than extending `ToolEnvelope` (that path has no action log to attach intent to). — **Keep**
- R7: dispatch made to match the documented `register_follow_ups` contract; `edit.rs`'s non-committing ambiguous-match result confirmed load-bearing (drives `apply_at_occurrence_N`), kept as-is rather than "fixed" as a gate-failure workaround. — **Keep**
- Read tool image handling: `tokio::fs::metadata` stat runs before any classification; missing files are I/O errors for all kinds; success handlers register text/binary/image kinds only after a real filesystem observation. — **Keep**

### JSON-RPC driven protocol — T8-cli-jsonrpc
- R4: `initialize` result's `protocolVersion:"2.0"` replaced (not added alongside) by `protocol:"norn-driven/1"` (`DRIVEN_PROTOCOL_VERSION` constant) — the JSON-RPC version already rides every frame's `jsonrpc` tag. — **Keep**
- R5: typed stop carries per-variant detail beyond the bare `{reason}` sketched in the requirement — `schema_unreachable{attempts, validation_errors}`, `timed_out{elapsed_ms, iterations}`, `truncated{truncation, iterations}` — because with no `retryable` field on the wire, callers need variant detail to make the retry judgment themselves. — **Keep**
- R5: the `result` string label removed outright (replaced by `stop.reason`); `ENVELOPE_VERSION=1` introduced as the documented contract version. — **Keep**
- R2: in degraded mode, **both** `inject` and `cancel` are answered `-32603` and no cancel token is threaded into the step, per the requirement's literal contract. Agent noted an alternative was considered and rejected: cancel doesn't strictly need the router (token is local), so degraded mode *could* still serve `intervene/cancel` honestly. Flagged: **"flag if the owner prefers that partial-service behavior."** — **Discuss**
- R3 adjunct: mid-run `initialize` is re-served with capabilities (idempotent, read-only) instead of erroring; busy error is `-32000` (implementation-defined server-error range). — **Keep**
- R9: cancel ack status renamed from `"cancelling"` to `"cancel_requested"` — the ack only guarantees the signal was applied, not that the run has stopped; the terminal `stop.reason` is declared authoritative. — **Keep**
- Stop envelope deliberately omits any `retryable` field, per a **pre-made owner decision** (documented in `DRIVEN-PROTOCOL.md`; Gap C annotated SUPERSEDED) — included here for traceability, not new. — **Keep (already decided)**
- e2e round-trip asserts `event/progress` (not `event/message`) because the openai-compatible provider only ever emits `TextDelta`, never `TextComplete`. — **Keep**
- A `run/execute` prompt resolving entirely to a local slash command returns `result: null` (documented, existing behavior left as-is). — **Keep**
- Cancel-ack race resolved by documentation + the existing biased-select narrowing, not further code changes — ack means "signal applied," terminal `stop.reason` is authoritative. — **Keep**

### Macro / schema derive — T9-macros
- Untagged enums with more than one unit variant are rejected with a spanned compile error (serde deserializes every untagged unit variant from `null`, so a second is unreachable and the schema can't represent it faithfully). — **Keep**
- A single untagged unit variant emits `{"type":"null"}` — the exact shape serde accepts; the variant name never appears on the wire. — **Keep**
- Container `#[serde(default)]` does NOT relax a flattened field's inner required list (verified empirically against serde's own behavior). — **Keep**
- The split `(serialize = ..., deserialize = ...)` form of rename attributes is now supported, taking the deserialize side (schemas describe model input). — **Keep**
- Rename-rule precedence mirrors serde exactly: field `rename` > variant `rename_all` > container `rename_all_fields` (verified by probe). — **Keep**
- `trybuild = "1"` added as a crate-local dev-dependency (not workspace-level, since root `Cargo.toml` is out of ownership; matches how `syn`/`quote`/`proc-macro2` are declared). — **Keep**
- Diagnostic type rendering normalized via a display helper (`std :: path :: PathBuf` → `std::path::PathBuf`). — **Keep**
- Unknown `#[serde(rename_all)]` rule names are a hard spanned compile error, matching serde's own derive rejection. — **Keep**
- Tagged enum root schemas declare `type:"object"` (sound — every tagged variant is an object); untagged roots stay untyped since variants may be non-objects. — **Keep**
- `tool_args/mod.rs` and `follow_up/mod.rs` reduced to declarations + re-exports per CLAUDE.md; expansion logic moved to `tool_args/derive.rs` / `follow_up/expand.rs` (no API change). — **Keep**

### Provider / auth — T1-provider
- Error-body read timeout reuses the existing `ProviderConfig::timeout` stall deadline rather than a new knob — same per-phase stall semantics already bounding headers/inter-chunk gaps. — **Keep**
- Stalled error-body reads classify as retryable `Timeout` for **both** 5xx and 4xx statuses (the stall is a transport fault regardless of status); reason string deliberately avoids the `"HTTP 5"` prefix so classification doesn't get confused, status is still included for diagnostics. — **Keep**
- The existing `ProviderError::StreamInterrupted` (retryable `ConnectionReset`) is reused with chunk/event diagnostics rather than adding a new variant, matching what `openai_compatible` already raised for the same condition (`error.rs` was out of this track's ownership). — **Keep**
- Service-tier backend discriminator mirrors `capabilities()` exactly via one shared `is_chatgpt_backend()` so the two can never disagree. **Consequence flagged by the agent:** a Fast-tier request on an API-key Responses connection now fails typed `InvalidRequest` instead of silently borrowing the subscription mapping ("priority"). — **Discuss** (behavior change, worth confirming it's intended)
- State-mismatched `/auth/callback` requests are treated as foreign (404 + keep listening) rather than aborting the flow, so a forged/stale request can't kill a legitimate in-flight login. — **Keep**
- `parse_sse_bytes` kept as a `#[cfg(test)]` wrapper over `SseParser` so there is exactly one parsing implementation. — **Keep**
- `AuthManager` constructors became fallible (`Result<Arc<Self>, AuthManagerBuildError>`) because they now eagerly build the shared `reqwest::Client`; mapped to `ProviderError::ConnectionFailed` at the call site, matching existing precedent. — **Keep**
- `login()`/`logout()` keep their public signatures and use `OAuthHttpOptions::default()` internally — changing `LoginConfig`'s field set would break a struct literal outside this track's ownership (`crates/norn-cli/src/commands/auth.rs`). Full configurability is available via `AuthManager` + `OAuthAuthProvider::from_manager`; CLI-level plumbing is a recorded blocker, not done here. — **Keep** (note: CLI plumbing gap remains)

### LSP — T2b-lsp
- `LspLocation` convention fixed as **one-based** (requirement's stated preference) — producers already emitted one-based, so docs/tests were aligned to producers rather than converting every producer/consumer. — **Keep**
- `LspBackend` trait defaults for `test_runnables`/`related_tests` kept; production `WorkspaceLspBackend` impl is now real. Non-rust-analyzer servers report zero runnables with a debug log rather than a hard error; `METHOD_NOT_FOUND` maps to empty (degraded capability logged, protocol errors still propagate). — **Keep**
- A failed `didChange` for any stale tracked file evicts that entry and propagates the error to the in-flight call, rather than silently skipping it — caller sees the server-side failure instead of results computed against a known-stale view. — **Keep**
- Drop-based graceful shutdown only fires when the backend is the last `Arc` holder (diagnostic bridge may share it); with no async runtime at drop time, `kill_on_drop` remains the documented fallback. — **Keep**
- Stub-server tests gate on `python3` availability at runtime with a `tracing::info` skip line (per the no-`#[ignore]` rule), probing well-known absolute interpreter paths before `$PATH`. — **Keep**

### Config / profiles / skills — T6-config-profile-skill
- R1: `HookEntry.timeout` is **required** at the type level (plain `u64`, milliseconds) — omitting it is a typed deserialization error naming the field/file. A stale doc comment claiming it was optional was corrected. — **Keep**
- R3: `serde_ignored 0.1` added (pre-approved) for nested unknown-key detection. Documented limitation: `#[serde(flatten)]` sections buffer their content, so unknown keys inside a flattened section can't be reported. — **Keep**
- R5: capability resolution — `capabilities/` dirs are siblings of each `profiles/` scan dir; first-dir-wins shadowing mirrors profiles; an unresolvable capability reference is a typed error (never silently dropped); profile-level `disallowedTools` flows through a synthetic `_profile_disallowed` capability into `resolved_disallowed`. — **Keep**
- R6: skill shadowing precedence — earlier scan dir wins; within a dir, directory-form `SKILL.md` beats flat `.md`; lexicographic path order breaks same-name ties. — **Keep**
- R7: trigger glob compilation is cached process-wide (compile-once); a pattern reaching evaluation without parse-time validation is error-logged exactly once and cached as a permanent non-match — loud, never silently indistinguishable from no-match. — **Keep**
- R10a: undefined positionals (`$N` with no value) pass through literally; recognized tokens with a missing value resolve to empty string. — **Keep**
- R10d: an unavailable bash binary surfaces via an inline `[skill shell command failed: …]` marker rather than aborting expansion, consistent with the stage-1 failure policy. — **Keep**

### Session — T5-session
- R2 off-executor design: `EventStore::checkpoint_off_executor(self: Arc<Self>)` is the documented step-boundary async wrapper (spawn_blocking) around the sync checkpoint, which remains the primitive (required by `JsonlSink::Drop` and sync embedders). `JoinError` maps to a typed `SessionError::StorageError` with explicit "flush landed is unknown" semantics. — **Keep**
- `tree::branch` failure ordering: `Fork` event appends before child insertion; the theoretically unreachable parent-vanished-after-append case returns a typed `StorageError` rather than silently inserting an unlinked child. — **Keep**
- `RevertStatus` gained an `Unknown` variant (breaking enum change) for files unreadable for reasons other than absence, so evidence-free comparisons never miscalibrate the revert baseline. — **Keep**
- `conversion.rs` uses `serde_json::Value`'s total `Display` (compact JSON) instead of a fallible serializer round-trip, removing the silent empty-string collapse without introducing a new fallback. — **Keep**

### Loop / agent runtime — T4-loop-agent, seam I2
- Item 2: step-exit sweep re-stamps `msg.to_id` to the loop's own agent id before re-queuing; when the loop context has no agent identity or pending store, the loss is logged at error level per message rather than passing silently. — **Keep**
- Item 2: `InboundChannel::recv()` added as the idle-park wake primitive; it currently has no in-crate production caller — deliberate, so the recorded blocker fix isn't itself blocked on this track's files. `steer_ready()` was deliberately not reused (its update-suppressing wake protects a *running* loop; a parked agent has none, and parking must not strand acknowledged messages). — **Keep**
- Item 8 (verified from a prior pass): an in-band `ProviderEvent::Error` now fails the call immediately in `loop/classify.rs::call_provider` with its typed `ProviderError`, so the retry policy classifies the real error; the `loop/assembly.rs` Error arm is documented as unreachable through the loop. — **Keep**
- Item 11: compaction summarization retry stays single-attempt with digest fallback, per the **June owner decision**; now additionally cancel-responsive (raced against the step's `CancellationToken`; a cancelled trigger commits nothing). — **Keep (already decided)**
- Seam 1 (final shape): `apply_persisted_compactions` runs exactly once per loop context, gated by `LoopContext.compaction_marks_loaded` — covers drivers resuming with a fresh `ContextEdits`; every compaction appended afterward marks supersession at commit time. Constant-time per step, no information loss. — **Keep**
- Seam 2: offload primitive chosen was `tokio::task::block_in_place`, not `spawn_blocking`/`checkpoint_off_executor` — the step API hands the loop `&EventStore` (borrowed, not `Arc`); `block_in_place` is the borrowed-data form of the same offload, keeps appends strictly ordered per session, and surfaces the `Result` exactly as an inline append would. Gated on `RuntimeFlavor::MultiThread`; current-thread runtimes append inline. — **Keep**
- Seam 3: the idle-park select arm carries an `inbound_open` guard — once all senders drop, `recv()` returning `None` permanently disables the arm instead of resolving instantly forever. — **Keep**
- Seam 3: sweeps treat `Steer` and `Update` identically (FIFO into the pending store) — a stranded message has no live loop, so the kinds' delivery-timing distinction doesn't apply at requeue time. — **Keep**
- `agent/pending_messages.rs`: audit appends now route through `append_off_executor` for the same off-executor guarantee, since they ride the drain/requeue hot path. — **Keep**

### Error taxonomy / reasoning replay — seam I1-error-taxonomy-reasoning
- `StreamError` uses a single `transient: Option<TransientKind>` field instead of separate status+transient fields — `TransientKind::ServerError` already carries the status, avoiding a contradictable second field. — **Keep**
- `ConnectionFailed` was also structured (`kind: TransientKind`) even though the spec named only `StreamError` — `class()` string-matched `"timed out"` on its reason too, and the seam's goal is finishing the magic-string kill. Producers only ever set `Timeout` or `ConnectionReset`. — **Keep**
- `server_is_overloaded`/`slow_down` keep `ServerError{status: 503}` as the structural classification (preserves every existing status-specific retry policy), but the `"HTTP 503:"` reason-prefix encoding hack was removed — reasons now carry the provider message verbatim. — **Keep**
- In-band error messages with no transport semantics (Chat Completions error frames, claude-runner error events, mock/lock-poison errors) are now always terminal (`transient: None`); previously a free-text `"timed out"` inside such a message could accidentally classify as retryable. Agent's own words: **"Deliberate, honest edge-behavior change."** — **Discuss**
- Missing/empty `tool_call_id` on `ToolResult` replay reclassified from `ResponseParseError` to `RequestSerializationFailed` in both serializers (it's a request-construction failure); classification (Terminal) unchanged. — **Keep**
- Reasoning replay wire shape follows the Codex CLI reference: `type:'reasoning'` with tagged `summary_text` parts, optional content parts, `encrypted_content` verbatim, `rs_*` item id omitted; items replay before the assistant message/tool calls of their turn; only items with `encrypted_content` are echoed. Codex's content-skip heuristic (skip content arrays lacking `reasoning_text`) was **not** copied — content is serialized whenever present. Agent flagged this explicitly as **"the one wire-format ambiguity."** — **Discuss**
- A wire reasoning item that fails to deserialize is dropped with a `tracing::warn` (mirroring `function_call`/`custom_tool_call` handling) — display text already flowed via thinking deltas; a fabricated partial item would corrupt replay. — **Keep**
- Malformed-item and unknown-`response.failed`-code paths never opt into retry (`transient: None`). — **Keep**

### CLI / TUI / config integration — seam I3-cli-tui-config-seams
- `SkillToolSettings.shell_execution` is `Option<bool>`; `None` defers to `SkillToolConfig::default()` (shell enabled) — no duplicated default in config code (NO ASSUMED DEFAULTS compliant). — **Keep**
- `tools.skill` merges field-by-field like `tools.write` (`merge_skill` mirrors `merge_write`); no validation entry added since a bool has no invalid range (sibling `write` settings have none either). — **Keep**
- Unknown-key allowlisting is structural: `parse_settings_with_unknown_paths` uses `serde_ignored` over the typed structs, so adding the typed field *is* the allowlist change (pinned by a loader test in both directions). — **Keep**
- TUI slash-dispatch path made async end-to-end (`try_dispatch_slash`, `handle_new`, `handle_compact`, `rotate_store_dependents`) instead of blocking the executor; added `with_scroll_region_cursor_async` (edition-2024 `AsyncFnOnce`) sharing cursor-reconcile logic with the sync wrapper. — **Keep**
- `turn.rs` awaits the checkpoint **before** the sync scroll-region closure (turn events are already appended, so ordering is unchanged); the failure message is carried into the closure for error-line rendering. — **Keep**
- `rotation.rs` now mirrors libnorn's `restore_session_state`: one `ReplayArtifacts` snapshot feeds both `ContextEdits::mark_superseded` and `rebuild_action_log`; `handle_new` resets `ContextEdits` **before** rotation so replayed marks are never wiped. — **Keep**
- Renderer `body()` restructured so `skipped`/`query_errors` render even when `matches`/`paths` are empty — previously the early-return silently dropped them (bug fix). — **Keep**
- Intra-doc link fixes used `crate::agent_loop` (existing pub re-export of `r#loop`, since rustdoc can't resolve `r#loop` in link paths); links to private items demoted to plain code spans rather than `#[allow]`ed. — **Keep**
- Shell-disabled `SkillTool` schedules as `ToolEffect::ReadOnly` (no shell can spawn), asserted end-to-end. — **Keep**
- `crates/norn/src/agent/monitor.rs` was deliberately **not** touched despite holding the last remaining rustdoc warning in the tree — it is on the HOLD-FOR-DISCUSSION list, which overrides the doc-comment ownership exception. — **Keep** (correctly honors the hold — see Section 4)

## 3. Proposed-but-not-implemented / explicitly flagged for owner discussion

These are the items agents themselves marked as unresolved, proposed-only, or requiring an
explicit owner call — either because implementing them would require inventing a default, or
because a design fork exists that the agent didn't feel authorized to resolve alone.

- **`step_timeout` graceful-timeout redesign** (T4-loop-agent, Item 6). Current hard-cut
  semantics (inner future dropped mid-tool-batch) are documented as-is. Agent explicitly wrote:
  *"PROPOSED FOR OWNER DISCUSSION, not implemented: a graceful-timeout redesign where elapsing
  the budget triggers the cancellation token plus a bounded grace period before the hard cut —
  the grace value would be an invented default, so it needs an owner decision."* — **Discuss**
- **Mustache reading session variables from user-supplied argument names** (T6-config-profile-skill,
  R10a). Left functional as-is. Agent's own tag: *"OWNER FLAG (as instructed): stage-3 mustache
  can read session variables whose names arrive from user-supplied arguments — left functional;
  needs an owner decision on whether user args should be able to name session variables."* — **Discuss**
- **Reasoning items not persisted into session `AssistantMessage` events** (seam
  I1-error-taxonomy-reasoning). — **DECIDED 2026-07-03 (owner): persist them.** The gap's other
  face surfaced in the `faaa1b04…` incident: a resumed session was ~30k tokens lighter than its
  live counterpart *because* the reasoning items evaporated — resume was acting as an
  accidental compaction while silently losing the model's reasoning state.
  `SessionEvent::AssistantMessage` now carries the captured `ReasoningItem`s
  (`encrypted_content` included; serde-defaulted so legacy files read as empty, key omitted
  when empty so non-reasoning sessions are byte-stable) and `session/conversion.rs` rebuilds
  `Message.reasoning` on resume. Session files grow accordingly — accepted; feeds the planned
  session-storage/prominence redesign (§0.5).
- **`loop/runner.rs` 500-LOC compliance gap — RESOLVED at Wave 4 (`3c84682`).** The draft
  flagged `loop/runner.rs` (852 LOC at the time) as an open CLAUDE.md-compliance gap dominated
  by the ~650-line `run_agent_step_inner`, deferred to a dedicated exclusive-ownership pass. That
  pass is Wave 4's R2 runner state machine: `loop/runner.rs` is now the `loop/runner/` directory
  (`machine.rs` 201, `dispatch.rs` 380, `entry.rs` 325, `setup.rs` 211, `provider_call.rs` 205,
  `prompt.rs` 170, `stop.rs` 131, `mod.rs` 37 — all non-test source under the 500-LOC cap), with
  the step loop reshaped as an explicit `StepMachine` (`StepMachine::initialize` →
  `StepMachine::run`). No longer an open gap. — **Resolved** (see §5.2)
- **T8-cli-jsonrpc R2 degraded-mode alternative** — implemented per the requirement's literal
  contract (both `inject` and `cancel` fail in degraded mode), but the agent flagged that
  `cancel` doesn't strictly need the router (its token is local) and a degraded run *could*
  still serve `intervene/cancel` honestly. — **Discuss**
- **T1-provider service-tier discriminator consequence** — a Fast-tier request on an API-key
  Responses connection now fails typed `InvalidRequest` instead of silently reusing the
  subscription "priority" mapping. Implemented deliberately for consistency with
  `capabilities()`, but it is a user-visible behavior change worth an explicit nod. — **Discuss**
- **T3-search `WalkBuilder::require_git(false)`** — implemented, but the agent explicitly wrote
  "needs sign-off" in its own decision record. — **Discuss**
- **T3-search binary/non-UTF-8 `InvalidData` silent-skip carve-out** — implemented, agent
  explicitly wrote "needs sign-off on the InvalidData carve-out." — **Discuss**

## 4. Held items (formerly `docs/HOLD-FOR-DISCUSSION.md`) — RESOLVED

Both items were held untouched through the campaign, then talked through with the owner on
2026-07-03 and **DECIDED: deleted**. The hold doc is retired; the forward design record is
`docs/design/norn/INTERNAL-AGENTS.md`.

1. **`RunMonitored` — AI-monitored background tasks** — **DECIDED 2026-07-03 (owner):
   deleted.** The scaffolding (`agent/monitor.rs`: zero production callers, unused `_provider`,
   static-string heartbeat around an in-process Rust future) implemented none of the actual
   intent, which the discussion surfaced as much larger: a taxonomy of *internal agents*
   (processors / watchers / assistant / speaker) built on a managed background-process manager,
   with watcher alerts riding message injection. None of the deleted code contributes to that
   design. See `docs/design/norn/INTERNAL-AGENTS.md` §5 (watchers) and §3 (process manager).

2. **`ToolEnvelope.runtime_inputs` + `ToolContext.runtime_args`** — **DECIDED 2026-07-03
   (owner): deleted; the architectural fork is ruled — boundary signals ride the durable
   message-injection path (`MessageRouter` + pending store + rules engine), never the tool
   envelope.** Rationale: injected messages are persisted as session events (resume-safe where
   envelope-ridden signals would silently vanish), they deliver on turns with zero tool calls
   (exactly when an interrupt matters most), and the envelope flows *to the tool* — splicing
   signals toward the model through it would pollute tool-result semantics and attribution.
   `runtime_args` separately: every policy input it was designed to carry became a typed,
   enforced surface (`workspace_root` confinement, `ToolOutputBudget`, pre/post checks,
   `extensions`, the permission policy); an untyped JSON blob beside those is a regression.
   Deleted: the `runtime_inputs` field, `RuntimeInputs`, `InboundMessage`, `DiagnosticReport`,
   `FileChange`, `FileChangeType`, and `ToolContext.runtime_args`. The envelope keeps its live
   parts (`model_args`, `tool_use_description`, `metadata`). Future diagnostics/filesystem
   feeds are producers into the injection path, per INTERNAL-AGENTS.md.

## 5. R1 assembly-unification (D1–D7) and Wave 3–4 decisions (post-draft)

Everything in §1–4 predates Wave 3. This section covers what landed after the draft: the seven
R1 open decisions (resolved autonomously per the campaign's standing "keep going" directive, all
reversible before merge — **owner may override any of these; flag on review**) and the
load-bearing decisions of the Wave 3 assembly-unification and Wave 4 runner/ordering/LOC work.
The R1 subsection reproduces `docs/design/norn/R1-DECISIONS-RESOLVED.md` (that file is the
authoritative source and is left unedited); the framing "applied autonomously, owner may
override" is intact.

### 5.1 R1 open decisions — applied autonomously (owner may override)

Source: `docs/design/norn/R1-DECISIONS-RESOLVED.md`, resolutions for
`BRIEF-R1-ASSEMBLY-UNIFICATION.md` §7. Owner was away at the decision point; these are the
recommended defaults. All verified against HEAD (`3c84682`).

- **D1 — Session-hook ownership: `Agent::run` fires them.** `Agent::run` fires
  `on_session_start`/`on_session_end` with `info.session_id`
  (`crates/norn/src/agent/instance.rs:247-257,295-297`); `into_parts` drivers (TUI, print
  step-loop) get explicit `fire_session_start`/`fire_session_end` helpers on `AgentParts`
  (`instance.rs:117,128`). Fixes the confirmed bug at the source — embedded agents (including
  every Meridian path) previously fired no session hooks. The `run` body even names Meridian in
  its rationale comment. Meridian can drop its hand-firing (see MERIDIAN-HANDOFF §9.1). —
  **Discuss** (owner-overridable; the applied default)
- **D2 — Root registry registration: opt-in.** `build()` reserves the `AgentRegistry` "/root"
  entry only when BOTH `.agent_registry()` and `.register_root(path, role)` are set; never
  mandatory. Embedders like Meridian wire no coordination and must not be forced to register a
  root; TUI/print opt in. — **Discuss** (owner-overridable)
- **D3 — Terminal-reclamation control: `.terminal_reclamation(bool)`, default `true`.** `true`
  preserves today's unconditional `install_terminal_reclamation`; the TUI passes `false` (its
  status panel owns reclamation). The default is the existing documented behavior, not an
  invented value. — **Discuss** (owner-overridable)
- **D4 — CLI session front door: `.open_session`.** `builder_from_cli` uses
  `.open_session(SessionManager, SessionSpec, DurabilityPolicy::Flush)` at build time;
  `--no-session` maps to `.session(EventStore::new())`. Print's post-build ordering for
  `debug_dump_file` is preserved by reading `parts.info.session_id`. — **Discuss**
  (owner-overridable)
- **D5 — Skill-tool registration gate: `load_runtime_base` path only.** `SkillTool` registers
  where the catalog + `SkillToolConfig` exist — the `load_runtime_base` extension path — gated on
  `!base.skill_catalog.is_empty()` (`crates/norn/src/agent/builder.rs:360-366`), mirroring the
  CLI's `!catalog.is_empty()` gate. Library agents built without `load_runtime_base` carry no
  catalog and so get no skill tool — correct. Registration happens before `from_profile` gating
  so allow/deny lists apply to it as in the CLI. — **Discuss** (owner-overridable)
- **D6 — Meridian migration scope: OUT of scope (norn only).** R1 exposes the library surfaces so
  Meridian *can* delete its copies (`NornSessionStore`; see MERIDIAN-HANDOFF §9.2) via
  `.open_session`, but the actual Meridian edits are a separate PR. The capability-discovery
  helper (§C) and shared provider defaults (§D) are NOT added to the library now — intentional
  Meridian copies until a future ask. — **Keep** (scoping decision; keeps this campaign
  norn-only and independently mergeable)
- **D7 — `event_schemas` / `variables` on the builder: yes.** `.event_schemas()` and
  `.variables()` added to `AgentBuilder` (additive; the CLI needs them and the builder is the
  assembler). Minor public-surface expansion. — **Keep**

### 5.2 Wave 3–4 load-bearing decisions

Decisions recorded in the Wave 3–4 commit record, verified against HEAD.

- **`SessionSpec` "latest" is working-dir-scoped, never global**
  (`crates/norn/src/agent/session_spec.rs:39,56`). The no-argument `--resume`/`--fork` sentinels
  map to `SessionSpec::ResumeLatestInWorkingDir` / `ForkLatestInWorkingDir`, which select the
  most-recently-updated session whose indexed working directory matches the current project —
  deliberately NOT the globally most-recent session across every directory, which would
  cross-contaminate unrelated projects. The empty-string "latest" sentinel is these variants, not
  `Resume`/`Fork`. — **Keep**
- **`ToolRegistry::names()` returns lexicographically-sorted names**
  (`crates/norn/src/tool/registry.rs:174-183`). The backing store is a `HashMap` (per-instance
  randomised iteration order); every prompt- and request-visible projection of the registry (the
  system prompt `# Tools` section, the provider tool-definition array via
  `collect_function_definitions`, the tool catalog, the MCP listing) is built from this iterator,
  so a stable order keeps those byte-identical between process runs and **preserves provider
  prompt caching** (the doc comment states this verbatim). — **Keep**
- **`ToolRegistry::is_registered` is the unmatched-flag-warning reference**
  (`crates/norn/src/tool/registry.rs:156`; used at
  `crates/norn-cli/src/runtime/wiring.rs:100`). It answers "is this a real tool at all?" (physical
  registration, ignoring effect-gating) so the CLI can warn when an `--allowed-tools` /
  `--disallowed-tools` flag names a tool that matches nothing, without false-flagging a tool that
  was correctly gated out. — **Keep**
- **`Box::pin` at the runner step seam** (`crates/norn/src/loop/runner/entry.rs:324`,
  `Box::pin(machine.run()).await`). The per-step driver future carries the whole step state
  (~16 KiB); pinning it on the heap keeps every embedder's future — spawned child steps, the TUI
  event loop, the CLI drivers — small instead of inlining that state into each
  (`clippy::large_futures`). One allocation per step; `initialize` is a separate statement so the
  completed init future is not held alive across the run. — **Keep**
- **R2 runner state machine** (`crates/norn/src/loop/runner/machine.rs`, `StepMachine::initialize`
  → `StepMachine::run`). The core step loop is reshaped from one ~650-line function into an
  explicit `StepMachine` split across the `runner/` submodules (setup / prompt / provider_call /
  dispatch / stop), resolving the §3 LOC gap. Behaviour-preserving refactor. — **Keep**
- **`Agent::run` auto-fires session hooks** — the D1 mechanism, restated here because it is a
  Wave 3 behavioral decision with external (Meridian) impact: the end hook fires only on the
  normal-exit path; an error short-circuits via `?` and skips it, matching the driver contract
  (`crates/norn/src/agent/instance.rs:250-252`). — **Discuss** (overlaps D1)
- **Skill-tool gate on non-empty catalog** — the D5 mechanism (see §5.1). Restated as a Wave 3
  decision because it is the one that lets embedded agents get the skill tool "for free" on the
  library path. — **Discuss** (overlaps D5)

## Summary

- **Section 1 (documented defaults):** 9 items, all pre-existing constants, all reused not
  invented, all Keep.
- **Section 2 (behavioral/semantic choices):** ~80 items across 10 subsystems, the large
  majority Keep; 4 flagged Discuss inline (degraded-mode cancel alternative, service-tier
  consequence, in-band-error terminal reclassification, reasoning-replay content-skip
  ambiguity).
- **Section 3 (explicitly proposed/flagged):** 8 items the agents themselves called out as
  needing an owner decision, ranging from a genuine feature-design question
  (`step_timeout` graceful redesign) to two explicit "needs sign-off" search-tool behaviors. The
  CLAUDE.md 500-LOC compliance gap (`loop/runner.rs`) is now **Resolved** at Wave 4 (R2 runner
  state machine, `loop/runner/`), leaving 7 open owner items in this section.
- **Section 4 (held):** RESOLVED 2026-07-03 — both items (`RunMonitored`,
  `ToolEnvelope.runtime_inputs` / `ToolContext.runtime_args`) owner-ruled **deleted**;
  boundary signals ride message injection. Forward design:
  `docs/design/norn/INTERNAL-AGENTS.md`.
- **Section 5 (R1 D1-D7 + Wave 3-4):** 7 R1 decisions applied autonomously (owner-overridable, 5
  Discuss / 2 Keep) plus 7 Wave 3-4 load-bearing decisions (mostly Keep). The three items in §0
  remain the highest-priority owner calls.
